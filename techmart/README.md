livelink: https://techmart-project.vercel.app/

This is a simple e-commerce application for a fictional online electronics store called TechMart Electronics. The application allows users to browse and search for electronics products, filter them by category, add items to their shopping cart, and view their cart.
### Technologies Used
1. React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
2. HTML: a markup language used to structure content on the web
3. CSS: a styling language used to add visual styles to HTML documents
4. JavaScript
## Features
1. Browse and search for electronics products
2. Filter products by category
3. Add items to shopping cart
4. Remove items from shopping cart
5. View cart and total price of items in the cart
### Components
#### ElectronicsList
This is the main component that renders the entire application. It fetches the list of electronics products from a server and passes them down to its child components.
#### SearchBar
This component is responsible for handling search queries entered by the user. It passes the search query up to its parent component, ElectronicsList.
##### CategoryFilter
This component allows the user to filter the list of electronics products by category. It also passes the selected category up to its parent component, ElectronicsList.
#### Cart
This component displays the items in the shopping cart and allows the user to remove items or view the cart.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
